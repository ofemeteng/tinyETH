# tinyETH

tinyETH is a secure comparison demo of a user's guess of the current ETH price in USD with the actual ETH price obtained from the etherscan.io API. It showcases the integration of a third party API using MPC to privately compare the response and the user input.

tinyETH is inspired by the tinybin demo from the Nillion team. If the user's guess is within +1% or -1% of the actual ETH price, then the result of the comparison will show that the user's has guessed correctly. If the guess is outside the stated +1% or -1% threshold, then the output will show that the user's guess is incorrect. 

This was my submission to the Nillion tinydemo library bounty.
